# ACL Standard and Extended Configuration

This repository contains a Cisco Packet Tracer project focused on configuring Standard and Extended Access Control Lists (ACLs).

## Description

This project demonstrates the configuration and implementation of both Standard and Extended ACLs in a simulated network environment. The aim is to control and secure network traffic by permitting or denying specific traffic based on various criteria.

### Key Features:
- **Standard ACLs**: Filter traffic based on source IP addresses.
- **Extended ACLs**: Filter traffic based on source and destination IP addresses, protocol types, and port numbers.
- **Network Topology**: A comprehensive network setup with routers, switches, and end devices to illustrate ACL applications.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ACL-Standard-Extended.git
   cd ACL-Standard-Extended
